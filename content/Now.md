👨🏻‍💻 Updated June 18th, 2023, from my home in Amoy.

## 🏠 Remodel my house
Finally, after 7 years of marriage, I bought a new home for my family. This means a lot to me and to my family. It costs a fortune, but definitely worth it. We'd ask a designer for this interior design thing and rebuild it, which I think takes at least half a year (hopefully).

## 📚 Reading

I bought like 21 books in the past few months, stacking them up on my bookshelf. Not sure if I’m addicted to reading or buying books… I consumed 4 or 5 of them already, and the one that I’m reading is Ikigai: The Japanese Secret to a Long and Happy Life.



## ✈️ Travel overseas

I’ve done 3 international travel since China reopening —— 2 in Manila, the Philippines and 1 in Sydney/Adelaide, Australia. I love intentional travel because it makes me feel good that I’m traveling with a specific purpose. It could be meeting someone or attending some events, whatever… Instead of just tourism.

I’m planning more trips to other countries in the next half of 2023. Germany is on the list for sure.

## 🏋️ Trainning 

I feel like I’m kind of incapable of lifting the same weight that I could after getting Covid, let alone increasing muscle from 35 kg and reducing my body fat percentage from 19.5%.

I paid for a personal trainer, and recently I hit a 100 kg squat. The pursuit of this little pain and the proper amount of dopamine really keeps me going.

## 🦷 Teeth repair

I got 3 teeth pulled out in early April —— I knew this would come sooner or later. I am just ready for it, even though it would take a lot of time (and money). I feel happy after solving a problem.

More than that, it ended up repairing my other 7 upper teeth (wtf), which were in pretty awful condition. Thanks, my dentist! Guy’s really doing great work.

The next step is for my 2 teeth to be implanted. I need to make a choice between a Swedish brand and a Swiss brand. Both of them are great and expensive as hell. This is an investment, isn’t it?
