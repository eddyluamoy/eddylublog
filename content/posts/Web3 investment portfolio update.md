It was hype, I was hooked. I got in NFT world. No regret, but just experiment and most importantly, exploring Web3 (kind of).

Documenting and sharing what I bought for this.

|NFT|ETH|Date|
|-|-|- |
|BBRC Ivy boys #6982|0.186|2022-06-22|
|Alpacadabra #9382|0.26|2022-05-06|
|Alpacadabra 3D #14979|0.161|2022-04-26|
|Zoofrenz 2.0 #7007|0.299|2022-04-21|

Remarks:
1. ETH value was like 3100 USD end of April (holy shit);
2. Gas fee was not calculated in above chart;
3. Other stupid purchases were not listed in above chart, which is not considered as building projects.

CPI statistics showed that the inflation rate in US days ago was 9.1%, still high, one of the reasons that I decided to DCA (dollar cost averaging) on BTC and ETH. A little pocket money USD 300 per month to start, I shoot that every 15th, ratio on BTC and ETH depends, but they have to go.

Back in 2015, there were 284 days horizontal price movement on BTC, so it really doesn’t matter when you got in.

Worst case, even you invested Dec 17, 2017, the starting point of bull market, you would start get 125% ROI, taking an example that you’d invest $1000 monthly to today, the money you put is $56,000, and the BTC acquired to be 5.499 btc, which equal to $126,056.

The best investment time? Now.
